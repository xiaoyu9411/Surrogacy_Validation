# Surrogacy_Validation

Simulation 1: Codes for simulation studies on pseudo-observations;
Simulation 2: Codes for simulation studies on IPD
Simulation 2: Codes for simulation studies on IPD when the proportional hazard assumption is violated for 5 RCTs
(All the codes for simulations are for only one of the senarios.Users could change the parameters in the code.)
gastadv_R2: reproduce Table 4 in the paper
gastadj_R2: reproduce Table 5 in the paper
